    <p> This Photo of above is of my dearest friend <b>Sheldon Teriyaki</b>. Many scientists believe that there hasn't been life on Mars for millions of years. Contrary to popular belief, Sheldon spent his early teen ages on a Tesla roadster driving on the surface of the Big Red planet.

    <p> <b>Now back on Earth</b>, Sheldon spends his summers in South America living inside a hut in the Amazon Rainforest. Sheldon is a master huntsman and fisherman which enables him to survive in the jungle. Legends say that Sheldon once had to fight off a pack of jaguars with nothing but his bare hands.

    <p> In Sheldons free time, he enjoys horseback riding, going bowling with kids, coaching a mens softball team, and building birdhouses in his garage. Sheldon also is a Formula 1 racing driver. He has won many races including his most famous win against Timmy Terry in 1984 on the Speedy McSpeedway in Toyko Japan.
