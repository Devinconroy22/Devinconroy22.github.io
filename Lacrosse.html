Austin Prep. played in the CCL (Catholic Conference League) against teams like Bishop Fenwick, Cardinal Spellman, and Arlington Catholic.

    <p> I am a sophmore midfeilder for the University of Maine's Club Lacrosse Team. Last year when I was a freshman members of the team brought the program back to the university. We played 3 games at the end of 2017 facing off against Maine Maritime Academy, Husson University, and St.Josephs University.
