    <b> Who we are </b>
   
   
    <p> 
        I am a part of greek life at the University of Maine. I am a brother of the Lambda Chi Alpha chapter. Our chapters house is located at 95 college ave in Orono Maine.

    <b> Our Brothers </b>
    
    
    <p>
        Many of our brother are magicians in their free time and also three of our brothers know how to fly planes. One of our members is named Ryan Palliwoda and he is a master chef. His favorite meal is flaming hot cheetos with guda cheese melted on top. Another friend of mine who is a member competes in pogo sticking competitions. All of these special brothers take part in Pumpkin Bust every Fall where other students come to our house to smash pumpkins!

    <b> Getting Involved </b>
    
    
    <p>
        Lambda Chi Alphas main philanthropy even is called "Feeding America". Feeding America allocates resources towards those in need. Our goal is to end world hunger so our brother go door to door and leave bags with homeowners that we collect a week later. The homeowners put unparishable food items in the bag and leave them for us to collect.
